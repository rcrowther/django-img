    #NB In stock Django,
    # - The model ImageField does routing, not validation, not even 
    # through FileField
    # - The form FileField read-checks files. It checks if a file exists, 
    # has a size, and that the filename is not too long.
    # - The form ImageField goes a little further. It checks Pillow can 
    # read the file, that Pillow.verify() does not think it is broken, 
    # that the MIME type is coherent, then validates the extension 
    # against Pillow data.
    # - Interesting, ImageFile itself has a little checking, as it must 
    # rescue dimension data from Pillow.

    # classes. But adds some init vals, bytesize handling, and it's
